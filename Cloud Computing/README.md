# Productivity Pilot
## Bangkit 2023 Project Capstone: ProductivityPilot

Several APIs have been created, but they are not used because it turns out that the data can be retrieved directly by Android using Firebase. Some of the basic APIs that have been created include:
- Login
- User Authentication
- Create Users
- Camera Usage
- Leaderboard
- Profile

However, in the end, all of the above APIs were not used because the data could already be retrieved directly from Firebase.

We configure user authentication for in-app sessions, firestore database to store user data, and cloud storage to store models used for mobile apps in Firebase.

## Data Collection

1. User Authentication with (email/password?)
